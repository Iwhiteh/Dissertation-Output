```

Plotting the distribution of Herring log(PPMR) as weighted by prey biomass and number of prey (with weighted normal distribution curves plotted over the top of each).

1. No weighting
2. Weighted by prey biomass
3. Weighted by number of prey per stomach

The fourth graph is the two differently weighted log(ppmr) v density graphs plotted over each other.

Prey biomass weighted mean: 6.629177
No. of prey weighted mean: 13.54102

The mean is shifted by 6.911843.

What does this mean?

```

Playing around with data to see any specific correlations; what is the distribution of the weight of prey recorded.

1. Prey weight v. no. prey per stomach
2. Log (prey weight) v. no. prey per stomach -> showed some interesting results, so added colours to identify individual ships
3. Graph 3., but with points from each ship plotted on separate graphs -> note y prop. to e^-x relation for END04; lots of observations for single weights for LUC and CLYDE; lots of the same no. of fish observations for HIDDINK.

Also, I found that the EXCmacDATSTO815 and Excmacdatsto815error gave exactly the same data (which might need to be considered in later calculations).

1. Prey weight v. predator weight -> attempting to find a link between the predator mass and the prey mass  
2. log(prey weight) v. log(pred. weight) ->  using log() to see proportionality of the axes, slope of added line should = PPMR  
3. Looking to find correlation between the masses for each individual species; the slope should intersect the y-axis at 0, else our idea for PPMR calculation (pred mass is prop. to prey mass) is incorrect. The slope shows the relation between predator and prey mass, i.e. the ppmr for each individual predator species.  

# Predator weight v. ppmr
```{r pred weight v. ppmr, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data=renamed_df, aes(log(pred_weight_g), log(ppmr))) + 
  geom_point(size=0.001) +
  labs(title = "log(pred mass) v. log(ppmr) plot", x="log(Pred mass)", y="log(PPMR)") + 
  stat_smooth (method='lm', se=FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~pred_species, scale="free_y")

#Focusing in on just poor cod
species_df <- renamed_df %>% filter(pred_species == fixed("Poor Cod"))

ggplot(data=species_df, aes(log(pred_weight_g), log(ppmr))) + 
  geom_point(size=0.5) +
  labs(title = "log(pred mass) v. log(ppmr) plot: Poor Cod", x="log(Pred mass)", y="log(PPMR)") + 
  facet_wrap(~pred_species, scale="free_y") + 
  stat_smooth(method=lm)

species_slope <- coef(lm(log(species_df$ppmr)~log(species_df$pred_weight_g)))
print(paste("slope of the log(ppmr) v. log(pred_weight) line of best fit for poor cod:", species_slope[2]))
```

Graphing log(pred mass) v. log(ppmr) for individual predator species to see if predator mass related to the ppmr.

i.e. we want them to not be proportional (i.e. slope = 0) to prove that log(predator mass) is not related to the log(ppmr) (and hence the ppmr is independent of the predator mass for a certain species).

First, plot graphs of log(pred mass) v. log(ppmr) for each individual predator species, with line of best fit on each graph

Looking at just the predator species 'poor cod'.
This graph includes a region of error for the line of best fit .

HOW TO ADD THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LOBF

# Introducing a mixed effects model

```{r first mixed effects, echo=TRUE}
#fixed: pred_species and prey_weight_g
#random: haul_id_short
lmer(log(ppmr) ~ pred_species + prey_weight_g + (1|haul_id_short), data = renamed_df)

#fixed: pred_species and prey_weight_g
#random: haul_id_short, year, no._prey_per_stmch, ices_rectangle
lmer(log(ppmr) ~ pred_species + prey_weight_g + (1|haul_id_short) + (1|year) + (1|no._prey_per_stmch) + (1|ices_rectangle), data = renamed_df)

#Generally: lmer(fixed ~ (1|random) + linear)
```

Fixed effect: log(ppmr)

Random effects: haul_id_short, year

Linear fixed effects: pred_species, prey_weight_g
